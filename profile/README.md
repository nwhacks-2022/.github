# talko

Hello! talko is a project for nwHacks 2022.

talko is an app that helps you practice for interviews. Record and time your answers to interview questions to get
immediate feedback on how fast you're talking and view previous recordings.

Interviews can be scary, but they don't have to be! We believe that practice and experience is what gives you the
confidence you need to show interviewers what you're made of.

## Features
- Feedback after every question: get your words per minute and learn to pace yourself while answering questions.
- Adorable robots.

## Technical Overiview
--> Frontend overview

We created the backend using Nodejs and Express. The api handles uploading and saving recordings, as well as retrieving them.

## Challenges & Accomplishments
Creating this project in just 24 hours was quite the challenge! While we have worked with some of these tools before,
it was our first time working with Microsoft Azure and Figma. We're really proud of what we managed to put together over
this weekend.

## What's next for talko?
- Tagged questions: get questions most relevant to your industry
- Better answer analysis: use different NLP APIs and assess the text to give better stats and pointers
  - Are there lots of pauses and filler words in the answer?
  - Is the answer related to the question?
  - Is the tone of the answer formal, assertive?
- View answer history in more detail: option to show transcript and play back audio recordings
