Hello! talko is a project for nwHacks 2022.

Interviews can be scary, but they don't have to be! We believe that practice and experience is what gives you the
confidence you need to show interviewers what you're made of. talko is made for students and new graduates who want to
learn to fully express their skills in interviews. With everything online, it's even more important now that you can
get your thoughts across clearly virtually.

As students who have been and will be looking for co-ops, we know very well how stressful interview season can be;
we took this as our source of inspiration for talko.

talko is an app that helps you practice for interviews. Record and time your answers to interview questions to get
immediate feedback on how fast you're talking and view previous recordings.

## Features
- Feedback after every question: get your words per minute and learn to pace yourself while answering questions.
- Adorable robots!!

## Technical Overview
--> Frontend overview

We created the backend using Nodejs and Express. The api handles uploading, saving and retrieving recordings, as well as fetching random questions from our question bank. We stored audio files in Microsoft Azure storage, and data and questions in Google Cloud Firestore.

## Challenges & Accomplishments
Creating this project in just 24 hours was quite the challenge! While we have worked with some of these tools before,
it was our first time working with Microsoft Azure and Figma. We're really proud of what we managed to put together over
this weekend.

## What's next for talko?
- Tagged questions: get questions most relevant to your industry
- Better answer analysis: use different NLP APIs and assess the text to give better stats and pointers
  - Are there lots of pauses and filler words in the answer?
  - Is the answer related to the question?
  - Is the tone of the answer formal, assertive?
- View answer history in more detail: option to show transcript and play back audio recordings

## Built using
- Nodejs
- React
- Express
- ffmpeg
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Firestore
